##Multiples of 3 and 5
Compared to the first month goal behind this one is to sift through a list of numbers, that vary in size and find
the number that is a multiple of 3 or 5.  Once that number is a multiple you take that list and add it together to get the sum of all of the multiples of 3 and 5.  So this is the use of loops and very minimal work in manipulating arrays.
