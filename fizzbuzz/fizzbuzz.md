##FizzBuzz

One of the first and classic coding problems given to weed out individuals who know what they are doing and those who don't. The summary of the problem
is to take numbers 1 to 100 and find the multiples of 3 and 5. If the number is a multiple of 3 the program should print out "Fizz". If the number is a
multiple of 5 the program should print out "Buzz" and if the number is a multiple of 3 and 5 the program should print out "FizzBuzz."
