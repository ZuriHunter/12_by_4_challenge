##12 Algorithms 4 Languages Challenge

Graduating from college with a Computer Information Systems major my degree didn't contain the code and theory intensive classes that a normal
Computer Science student would have so often when facing technical interviews, I didn't have that much confidence in solving Algorithms.  Although
I know the basics in the languages, data structures and many useful algorithms that I study and I am able to put together great web applications I
still manage to lose my confidence in solving algorithm problems.  In so, with my first year out of college and first year with my tech job I
decided to try the "12 Algorithms 4 Languages Challenge." This is a challenge that I made up myself to help improve my technical problem solving skills
in the four languages that I have learned in my 3 years of studying programming.

1. Ruby
2. Python
3. Javascript
4. Java

All four languages are listed in the order of how I feel I have the strongest skill level.  The key objective is once a month I tackle an algorithm problem
that are common in technical interviews and related to real world problems and solve them in my own special way in all four languages.  At the end of the
I should have 12 Solved Algorithm problems in Ruby, 12 Solved Algorithm problems in Python, 12 Solved Algorithm problems in Javascript and 12 Solved
algorithm problems in Java.  

The order of problems goes as follows:

* January = Fizz Buzz FizzBuzz

* February = To Be Determined

* March = To Be Determined

* April = To Be Determined

* May = To Be Determined

* June = To Be Determined

* July = To Be Determined

* August = To Be Determined

* September = To Be Determined

* October = To Be Determined

* November = To Be Determined

* December = To Be Determined
